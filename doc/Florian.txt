I thought that the most challenging part of the project would have been writingin assembly. However coding the assembler in C was the trickiest as C was new tome and the tasks in assembly were straightforward. I had to get used to drawingflowcharts and writing pseudo codes for part II as it made my task easier.I found my programming skills were not on par with those of my team members. Iverified if I understood the concepts before coding. I kept my team leaderinformed of my progress as I made it easier for him to help me. When I wasworking on a task with someone, I was always open to his suggestions since wecan find what we think is the best solution faster.In a different team, I would keep my team (especially team leader) informed ofmy progress in the task at hand I would also like to be more independent when Iam assigned an individual task.
